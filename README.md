# Yulu - Hypothesis Testing üö≤üìà

Welcome to the **Yulu Hypothesis Testing Project**.

**Yulu** is India‚Äôs leading micro-mobility service provider, focused on reducing traffic congestion through shared electric cycles for daily commuting.

## About Yulu üåü

Yulu operates across metro stations, bus stops, office spaces, residential areas, and corporate offices, offering affordable and sustainable transport options.

Recently, Yulu has been facing revenue challenges and partnered with a consulting firm to identify factors influencing the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. This project aims to provide actionable insights.

## Project Goals ü§ù

- Identify key variables that influence the demand for shared electric cycles.
- Measure how effectively these factors explain rental demand.

---

## Dataset Overview üìä

### Columns:
- `datetime`: Date and time
- `season`: 1 = Spring, 2 = Summer, 3 = Fall, 4 = Winter
- `holiday`: Indicates if the day is a holiday
- `workingday`: 1 = Working day, 0 = Non-working day
- `weather`: Weather conditions
- `temp`: Temperature in Celsius
- `atemp`: Feels-like temperature in Celsius
- `humidity`: Humidity percentage
- `windspeed`: Wind speed
- `casual`: Count of casual users
- `registered`: Count of registered users
- `count`: Total number of cycle rentals (casual + registered)

---

## Statistical Methods Used üìö

- Bi-variate analysis
- 2-sample t-test
- ANOVA
- Chi-square test

---

## Analysis Workflow üö¶

1. Import the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Analyze relationships between the `count` variable and features like `workingday`, `weather`, and `season`.
3. Select suitable statistical tests to determine:
   - Effect of working days on rentals.
   - Seasonal differences in rentals.
   - Impact of weather on rentals.
   - Relationship between weather and seasons.
4. Define hypotheses:
   - Null hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)
   - Alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)
5. Check test assumptions (normality, equal variance) using plots or tests like Shapiro-Wilk and Levene‚Äôs test.
6. Perform statistical testing and calculate significance levels (alpha).
7. Draw conclusions based on test results.

## Objective üéØ

Help Yulu make data-driven decisions to improve micro-mobility services through clear and actionable insights.

## Business Insights and Recommendations
 
1. Seasonal Demand for Bicycle Rentals:
 Peak Demand: Rentals are highest in Summer and Fall, likely due to comfortable weather and increased outdoor activities.
Lowest Demand: Spring has the least rentals, possibly due to fluctuating weather conditions. Winter shows moderate demand, suggesting some adaptation to colder conditions. 
2. Weather Conditions Across Seasons:
   - Clear/Partly Cloudy: The most common weather across all seasons, especially in Winter and Fall.
   - Misty Weather: The second most frequent condition, primarily in Winter, which might reduce visibility and slightly impact rentals.
   - Light Snow/Rain: Less frequent, but Winter sees the most occurrences, potentially causing slight declines in demand.
   - Heavy Rain/Snow: The least common weather condition, but when it occurs, it significantly reduces bicycle rentals.
3. Significant Relationship Between Weather & Season:
The Chi-square test confirms a strong association between weather conditions and seasons (p-value = 1.5499e-07) . Certain weather types are more prevalent in specific seasons, directly influencing rental demand.
4. Impact of Weekdays vs. Weekends on Rentals:
No significant difference in rentals between weekdays and weekends . This suggests a consistent demand across all days, possibly due to a mix of work and leisure users.
5. Impact of Weather & Season on Rental Demand:
Weather significantly affects rentals : Clear weather increases demand, while rain/snow reduces it.
Seasonal influence is strong : Rental numbers fluctuate notably between different seasons.
## Recommendations:
1. Optimize inventory & pricing : Increase bicycle availability in Summer & Fall, adjust pricing during low-demand seasons.

2. Weather-based promotion strategies : Offer discounts or incentives on misty/light rain days to maintain rental activity.

3. Infrastructure improvements : Consider covered parking spots & rain-resistant gear for bikes to encourage rentals in bad weather.

4. Targeted marketing : Promote weekday rentals to commuters and weekend rentals to leisure users for consistent demand.
